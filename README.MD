# Multimodal Heart Pressure Prediction

This repository contains code for preprocessing and analyzing ECG and SCG signals for heart pressure prediction.  

---

## 🐍 Python Version

The preprocessing script (`preprocessing.py`) is **tested with Python 3.11.14** due to compatibility issues with the `wfdb` library. Using other Python versions may result in errors.

## ⚡ Recommended Setup

It is **strongly recommended** to use a **virtual environment** to avoid modifying your global Python installation. This keeps dependencies isolated and prevents conflicts between projects.

### Create a virtual environment

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder
cd /path/to/Mutlimodal-heart-pressure-prediction

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment (Linux/macOS)
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate the environment (Windows PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
